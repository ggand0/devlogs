- inspired by the youtube warehouse dodgeball game
- initially started out with DQN + level1 easy level
- took a bit of time to implement the skybox
- enhanced the game
- game settings configurable via API from the python side
- level2 (to make it more interesting): initially did +- 60 angles but too hard
- tried +- 20 angles with PPO: somehow worse, 30 angles was better
- trained 2M+ iterations with this settings, but plateaued with no significant improvement
- finally tried SAC, siginificantly better results!
